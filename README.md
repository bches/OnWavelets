# OnWavelets
A basic tutorial on wavelet compression

This tutorial borrows heavily from the Wavelet example in Introduction to Linear Algebra by Dr. Gilbert Strang (p. 391-392).  This tutorial demonstrates the example in numpy, and shows the python code for calculating the Wavelet coefficients by recursion for this example.  This is a one-dimensional example
