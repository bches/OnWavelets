# OnWavelets
A basic tutorial on wavelet compression

This tutorial borrows heavily from the Wavelet example in Introduction to Linear Algebra by Dr. Gilbert Strang (p. 391-392).  This tutorial demonstrates the example in numpy, and shows the python code for calculating the Wavelet coefficients by recursion for this example.  

There are two python notebooks in this repository.  There is a one-dimensional example (WAVELETS.ipynb) which also shows how the 1-D Wavelet transform is calculated by recursion.  There is also a two-dimensional example (WAVELETS.ipynb) which shows the transform on greyscale images.
